## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Cloudflare account
- Solana RPC endpoint (Helius, Triton, or QuickNode)
- Wrangler CLI installed globally: `npm install -g wrangler`

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HybieGee/RaffleSolana.git
cd RaffleSolana
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Configure your `.env.local` with:
   - `SOLANA_RPC_URL`: Your Solana RPC endpoint
   - `TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS`: SPL token address for holder weighting
   - `CLAIM_RECEIVER_WALLET`: Your wallet where you claim fees TO from Pump.fun
   - `MARKETING_WALLET`: Wallet to receive 5% for marketing
   - `PAYOUT_SIGNER_SECRET`: Base64 encoded secret key for payouts
   - `NETWORK`: mainnet-beta or devnet
   - `ADMIN_TOKEN`: Secret token for admin endpoints

5. Create Cloudflare resources:
```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create KV_RAFFLE
wrangler d1 create raffle-db
```

6. Update `wrangler.toml` with the IDs from the previous commands

7. Run database migrations:
```bash
wrangler d1 migrations apply raffle-db
```

8. Start development servers:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Worker
npm run worker:dev
```

## Configuration

### Raffle Settings

Configure in `wrangler.toml` or environment variables:

- `ODDS_MODE`: `sqrt` or `log` - Algorithm for weight calculation
- `MAX_WEIGHT_RATIO`: Maximum advantage ratio (default: 5)
- `MIN_BALANCE_FOR_ELIGIBILITY`: Minimum token balance to participate

### Weight Calculation

**Square Root Mode**: `weight = sqrt(balance)`
- More balanced distribution
- Smaller holders have better relative odds

**Logarithmic Mode**: `weight = 1 + log10(1 + balance)`
- Even more compressed distribution
- Minimizes whale advantage

Both modes include:
- Soft cap limiting max advantage to `MAX_WEIGHT_RATIO`
- Floor weight ensuring all holders have a chance

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/status` - Current raffle status and next draw time
- `GET /api/winners?limit=N` - Recent winners
- `GET /api/odds?wallet=ADDRESS` - Calculate odds for a wallet
- `GET /stream` - Server-sent events for real-time updates

### Admin Endpoints (requires Authorization header)

- `POST /admin/force-draw` - Manually trigger a raffle draw
- `POST /admin/retry-payout?draw_id=ID` - Retry failed payouts

## Deployment

### GitHub Actions

The repository includes automated deployment via GitHub Actions:

1. Add secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

2. Push to main branch to trigger deployment

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Deploy Worker
npm run worker:deploy

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

### Cloudflare Pages Setup

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `out`
4. Configure environment variables in Cloudflare dashboard

## Monitoring

wrangler tail raffle-worker
```

### Database Queries

```bash
# View recent draws
wrangler d1 execute raffle-db --command="SELECT * FROM draws ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 10"

# View winners
wrangler d1 execute raffle-db --command="SELECT * FROM winners ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

2. **Payouts failing**: Verify signer wallet has sufficient SOL
3. **No holders found**: Check TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS and RPC endpoint
4. **SSE not updating**: Ensure CORS headers are configured

- Open an issue on GitHub
- Check Worker logs via `wrangler tail`
- Verify D1 data via SQL queries
